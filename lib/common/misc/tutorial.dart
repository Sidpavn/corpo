    "question": "YOU: Are these hitmen good?",
    "answer": "Absolutely. Each of our hitmen comes with their own archetype and unique set of skills. "
        "For instance, we've got The Ghost, who’s a master at sneaking around undetected. The higher their tier, the better their skills will be.\n\n"

        "These quirks can influence the outcome of a mission in unexpected ways.\n\n"
        "So, when you’re picking the right hitman for a job, focus on their skills but be ready to manage their quirks. "

        "They can range from expert marksmanship and hand-to-hand combat to stealth and hacking.\n\n"
        "For example, The Ghost excels at moving undetected and picking locks, while another hitman might be a sharpshooter or a tech wizard.\n\n"
        "These skills are crucial for completing missions successfully. The better the hitman’s tier, the more refined and effective their skills are.\n\n"
        "So, when planning a mission, think about what specific abilities you need and choose your hitman accordingly."

  {
    "question": "YOU: What are these quirks, you are talking about?",
    "answer": "Quirks are the unique traits and characteristics each hitman has, which can impact a mission in both good and bad ways.\n\n"
        "For example, a hitman might be incredibly brave, giving them an edge in dangerous situations, but they might also be overly reckless, which could put the mission at risk.\n\n"
        "You need to be aware of them and ready to adapt your plans accordingly. Understanding and managing these quirks is key to making the right calls when things get desperate."
